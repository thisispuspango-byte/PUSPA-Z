## 1. Executive Summary

PUSPA V5 is a full-stack, AI-augmented management platform for **Pertubuhan Urus Peduli Asnaf (PUSPA)**, a Malaysian NGO registered under PPM-024-10-05012022, operating primarily in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. The platform digitises and streamlines the end-to-end operations of managing asnaf (needy) beneficiaries — from member registration and eKYC verification, through case management and donation tracking, to disbursement processing and regulatory compliance.

The platform comprises **23 core modules** spanning operational management, compliance, and an AI assistant. At its centre is **Maria Puspa**, a RAG-grounded AI assistant with 18 tool-calling capabilities, bilingual fluency (Bahasa Melayu primary, English secondary), and strict adherence to mandatory tool use before answering — eliminating hallucination in operational data queries.

PUSPA V5 is built on **Next.js 16 (App Router)** with **Prisma ORM 6** and **PostgreSQL**, styled with **Tailwind CSS 4** and **shadcn/ui**, powered by **Zustand 5** for state management, and deployed to **Vercel (serverless)**. The AI layer uses **OpenRouter** with key rotation and SSE streaming. Authentication is handled by **Supabase Auth**.

### Key Differentiators

- **Mandatory RAG Architecture**: Maria Puspa must call tools before answering any operational query — never fabricates data
- **PII-First Design**: IC numbers masked to `****XXXX` at the data layer; PDPA-compliant by default
- **Shariah-Compliant Donation Tracking**: Native support for zakat, sadaqah, waqf, infaq, and general donations with compliance flags
- **9-Stage Case Workflow**: Draft → Intake → Verification → Assessment → Approval → Disbursement → Follow-Up → Closed / Rejected
- **8 Asnaf Categories**: Fakir, Miskin, Amil, Muallaf, Gharimin, Riqab, Ibnu Sabil, Fisabilillah — per Malaysian zakat classification
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: @MariaPuspaBot with long-polling, session management, and allowlist-based access control

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Pain Points

PUSPA, like many small-to-medium Malaysian NGOs, operates with fragmented systems:

1. **Manual Member Management**: Asnaf member records are tracked in spreadsheets, leading to data duplication, IC number exposure, and difficulty tracking eKYC verification status across 8 asnaf categories.

2. **No Case Lifecycle Tracking**: Welfare, medical, education, housing, emergency, and financial cases are handled ad-hoc with no structured workflow — resulting in lost follow-ups, unclear approval chains, and no audit trail.

3. **Donation Opacity**: Donations across 5 Islamic categories (zakat, sadaqah, waqf, infaq, general) are tracked manually with no shariah compliance flags, no automatic receipt generation, and no donor relationship management.

4. **Disbursement Gaps**: Disbursement processing lacks a defined stage pipeline, approval verification, or payment reference tracking — creating risk of duplicate or unverified payments.

5. **Compliance Blind Spots**: Regulatory obligations under ROSM (Registrar of Societies Malaysia), LHDN (Inland Revenue Board), and PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act 2010) are tracked manually with no overdue alerts or evidence management.

6. **No Institutional Knowledge**: PUSPA's organizational data (registration PPM-024-10-05012022, verified programmes 2021–2023, partner relationships with PKB, S P Setia Foundation, Jaya Grocer, LZS) is distributed across individuals with no central, queryable knowledge base.

7. **Volunteer Underutilisation**: Volunteer hours, skills, availability, and certificates are untracked — leading to poor deployment and no recognition system.

8. **No AI-Assisted Operations**: Staff must manually query multiple systems to get operational summaries, status checks, or compliance overviews — no conversational interface exists.

### 2.2 Impact

Without a unified platform, PUSPA risks: non-compliance penalties, donor attrition due to lack of transparency, inefficient disbursement cycles, inability to scale beyond current beneficiary count, and reputational risk from data breaches.

## 14. Open Issues & Risks

### 14.1 Technical Risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-001 | PostgreSQL connection limits under multi-user load | High — connection exhaustion | Low | Connection pooling via Prisma; `DIRECT_URL` for direct connections |
| RISK-002 | OpenRouter API rate limiting or downtime | Medium — AI unavailable | Medium | 4-key rotation; graceful fallback messages; `ping_system` health check |
| RISK-003 | AI hallucination in operational responses | High — incorrect decisions | Low | Mandatory RAG rules; PII masking; 2–3 sentence limit; tool-citation requirement |
| RISK-004 | Telegram bot token exposure | High — unauthorised access | Low | Environment variable only; allowlist enforcement; session role limits |
| RISK-005 | PII exposure via API response leakage | High — PDPA violation | Low | Data-layer masking; API response filtering; audit logging |
| RISK-006 | OpenRouter model deprecation | Medium — feature breakage | Low | Configurable model; OpenAI-compatible standard; fallback model chain |
| RISK-007 | Vercel serverless cold starts for AI | Medium — slow first response | Medium | Keep-warm pings; streaming for perceived performance |

### 14.2 Operational Risks

| ID | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RISK-008 | Staff resistance to digital platform adoption | High — low utilisation | Medium | BM-first interface; training sessions; Telegram bot for familiar channel |
| RISK-009 | Data migration from existing spreadsheets | Medium — data integrity issues | High | Migration scripts with validation; staged rollout; parallel operation period |
| RISK-010 | eKYC vendor integration complexity | Medium — delayed eKYC launch | Medium | Start with manual verification; add OCR/face match in Phase 3 |

| RISK-012 | Insufficient OpenRouter API budget | Medium — AI feature degradation | Low | Cost monitoring; key rotation for rate distribution; `tencent/hy3-preview:free` as cost-efficient default |

### 14.3 Open Issues

| ID | Issue | Status | Owner | Target Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OI-001 | `approve_disbursement` and `delete_case` tools are simulated (not persisted to DB) | Open | Engineering | Phase 3 — implement real DB mutations with audit trail |
| OI-002 | `delegate_task` tool returns simulated delegation response | Open | Engineering | Phase 4 — implement sub-agent spawning with result callback |
| OI-003 | Authentication enforcement on API routes (Supabase Auth configured but not fully enforced on all routes) | Open | Engineering | Phase 3 — enforce Supabase Auth on all `/api/v1/*` routes |
| OI-004 | AI module page requires Developer role — may be too restrictive for Admin users who want chat access | Under Discussion | Product | Consider splitting AI chat (Admin+) from AI config (Developer+) |
| OI-005 | Programme `type` field referenced in tools but not in Prisma schema | Open | Engineering | Add `type` field to Programme model or update tool queries |
| OI-006 | No automated testing framework configured | Open | Engineering | Phase 2 — add Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E |
| OI-007 | Audit trail for compliance status changes not tracked | Open | Engineering | Phase 3 — add ComplianceRecordChange model |
